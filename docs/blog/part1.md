# How My LG TV Betrayed My Trust

I recently experienced a frustrating betrayal by a company whose products I trusted—LG. Like many people, I bought a smart TV, expecting convenience, quality, and reliability. At the time of purchase, I thoroughly reviewed LG’s privacy policy and was satisfied with its terms, believing my privacy was respected.

That trust was shattered when my TV updated, suddenly presenting me with new terms of service. I vividly remember messaging a friend, telling them I was "apoplectic with rage at LG." Why? Because LG was now forcing me to agree to allow the TV to analyze audio from whatever content was playing—be it Netflix, Streamio, or anything else—and then sell that data to a dubious advertising partner. The audacity! I couldn’t use any apps without accepting this invasive tracking.

This move felt cynical and manipulative. I remember joking darkly to my friend about my brief dalliance with Streamio and its ethically questionable features, saying, "I was wrestling with my conscience over this, and I guess the Universe self-corrected and restored nihilistic equilibrium." But there was nothing funny about LG changing terms post-purchase in such a deeply intrusive way. Had these terms been clear at the outset, I would never have bought the TV.

Feeling betrayed, I resolved never to purchase another LG product again. Beyond that, my anger motivated action. Initially, I considered buying a  router with OpenWRT to block the TV from phoning home, even wondering aloud to my friend if selling pre-configured privacy routers might be a business idea born purely from spite. But luckily, I had a Raspberry Pi 4 and a spare USB ethernet adapter handy.

Rather than simply discard or replace the TV, I turned my frustration into an opportunity: using the Pi as a custom router and traffic analyzer. In the following posts, I'll detail exactly how I set this up, how I identified what LG was trying to track, and how I effectively blocked their surveillance. My friend jokingly said, "It'll be a great blog post," to which I responded skeptically that my initial reaction—"the first 10,000 words of unhinged invective before the tech part"—might be off-putting. However, now that the anger has subsided, I hope sharing this experience will help others protect themselves from similar betrayals.
